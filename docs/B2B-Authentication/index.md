!!! note
    This section draft includes general directions on how to integrate an Identity and Access Management system in a range of B2B and B2B2C setups. 

Here at IAM Auth, we allow B2B (business-to-business) customers to integrate Identity and Account Management into their services. 

From a broader perspective, our platform enables B2B customers to: 

- Enable organizations, e.g., the suppliers, and their employees to access corporate apps
- Grant and revoke organization and user access to apps and resources   
- Use role-based access controls (RBAC) for management of roles and permissions across applications
- Integrate single sign-on (SSO) so users only need to log in once on all relevant apps

You can start out with our B2B solution here:
